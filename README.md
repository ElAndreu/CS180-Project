# Job Matcher AI Agent

An AI‑driven resume parser and job matcher built with CrewAI and Adzuna.  
Given a candidate’s resume (PDF), it:

1. **Parses** out skills, experience, and education.  
2. **Fetches** relevant job postings from Adzuna.  
3. **Ranks** them locally by keyword overlap.  
4. Returns the single best match as JSON.
